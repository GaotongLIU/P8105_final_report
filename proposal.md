**The motivation for this project**  
As civilizations are developing, the happiness of human being becomes an
ambiguous topic. Simple material enjoyment is no longer the only
determinant of mental pleasure. So, how the state of happiness in the
world change over time and what makes the world happy? We are trying to
find the reasons, and our final goal is to provide helpful information
for governments to make better decisions for higher life evaluation.  
**The intended final products**

  - Overall Global interactive map: All variables’ bar plots with
    happiness score in all countries in the world map over
    time(2015-2019)
  - Scatter plots and distributions of all variables
  - The correlation graph of happiness score(What kind of factors
    correlate to the happiness score?)
  - Map the happiness score and the main factor through principal
    component analysis, PCA (finding variables in World Development
    Indicator) to verify the correlation.
  - 2020 prediction: only time / based on component or factor to predict

**The anticipated data sources**: Github data file

  - World Happiness Report: from 2015 to 2019,
    [here](https://worldhappiness.report/download/). CSV files from
    Kaggle: [2015-2017](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness),
    [2018](https://www.kaggle.com/njlow1202/world-happiness-report-data-2018),
    [2019](https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/world-happiness-report-2019)

    indicator](https://www.kaggle.com/worldbank/world-development-indicators)

**The challenges**

  - The good interactive global map is hard to construct
  - Variables’ definitions are hard to explain in the correlation
    analysis
  - Deficiency of mathematical model knowledge background in the
    prediction model

**The planned timeline**  
11/08 - 11/15: Confirm definitions of variables, Tidy and clean multiple
datasets, combine GPS, suicide, terrorism  
11/16 -11/20: Correlation analysis and global map 11/21 - 11/25: Global
map with factors and prediction  
11/26 - 12/1: Website and screencast 12/2 - 12/5: Final report
