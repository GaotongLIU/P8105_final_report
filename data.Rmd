* LOG GDP per capita: the log value of GDP per capita (variable name gdp) in purchasing power parity (PPP).
* Social support: the national average of the binary responses (either 0 or 1) to the GWP question “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?”
* Healthy life expectancy at birth: Healthy life expectancies at birth are based on the data extracted from the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Global Health Observatory data repository.
